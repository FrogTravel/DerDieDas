    <string name="full_words_text">\"Fully learned words\" means nouns that have been answered correctly 5 times in a row. They are then considered \"fully learned\" and don\'t appear anymore in the practice screen. The ultimate goal should be to \"fully learn\" all nouns.\n\nIf a noun is answered correctly, but then incorrectly before achieving 5 times in a row, it is reset back to 0 and the process of getting 5 times in a row starts again for that noun.</string>
